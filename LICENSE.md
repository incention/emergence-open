## You are free to:

* **Share** — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format
* **Adapt** — remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.

The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow these license terms:

* **Attribution** — You must give appropriate credit: "Emergence by Incention" and include a link to (https://www.emergenceuniverse.com/), provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.
* **No additional restrictions** — You may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits.
* **Scope of License** — This Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License applies ONLY to the Emergence 2D and 3D assets explicitly included in this initial release package (v1.0), dated 2025/04/21.

This license does NOT extend to:
1. ANY future Emergence 2D or 3D asset releases, unless otherwise stated in such future releases. Incention reserves all rights to release future Emergence assets under different licensing terms, including commercial licenses that may require royalty payments.
2. The underlying intellectual property rights of the Emergence Universe, all of its storylines, characters, settings, objects, fx and concepts, etc., including those that the released 2D and 3D assets are based on (such as Captain Skadi and The Bellerophon) which shall remain the intellectual property of Incention. This license does not transfer ownership of the intellectual property rights regardless of how the 2D and 3D assets are used.
3. Written materials such as the Emergence World Bible, Origin Stories, or other narrative content, which are subject to separate copyright protections.
4. Commercial use beyond the scope defined in the CC BY 4.0 license.

## Future Licensing

Incention may in the future offer additional licensing options through emerging intellectual property management platforms such as Story Protocol (https://portal.story.foundation/). These platforms provide programmable IP licensing that can better automate attribution, royalty distribution, and derivative rights.

The license terms for these 2D and 3D assets may evolve as IP infrastructure modernizes, potentially offering creators more sophisticated ways to collaborate with and build upon the Emergence universe while ensuring proper attribution and compensation for original IP holders.
